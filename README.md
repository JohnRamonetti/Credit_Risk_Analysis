# Credit_Risk_Analysis
MODULE 17 - Supervised machine learning

## OVERVIEW
  ### Purpose:  The purpose of the current analysis was to assess the performance of various algorithms/computer learning models in predicting credit risk.  Specifically, credit card data taken from LendingClub was subjected to analysis under the following algorithms and machine learning models:  RandomOverSampler, SMOTE, ClusterCentroids, SMOTEENN, BalancedRandomForestClassifier and EasyEnsembleClassifier.  Each model was applied to predict credit risk.  The performance of each model was then evaluated using a balanced accuracy score, confusion matrix and sensitivity (recall), precision and f1 scores.

## RESOURCES
  - Data Source: LoanStats_2019Q1.csv
  - Software:  Python 3.7.7, Anaconda, Jupyter Notebook, Pandas Library, sklearn, imblearn 

## RESULTS
  1. RandomOverSampler - The Random oversampling algorithm yielded a balanced accuracy score of 65.6%.  Precision was 0.01 for high_risk borrowers and 1.00 for low_risk borrowers.  Sensitivity(recall) was 0.69 and 0.62 for high and low_risk borrowers respectively.
  3. SMOTE Oversampling -  
  4. ClusterCentroids Undersampling - 
  5. SMOTEENN Combination Over/Under sampling - 
  6. BalancedRandomForest Classifier - 
  7. EasyEnsembleClassifier -
